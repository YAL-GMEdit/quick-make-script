# Quick, make script!

**Quick links:** [itch.io page](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmedit-quick-make-script)

This [GMEdit](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmedit) plugin allows to quickly create scripts right from the code editor - hit a keyboard shortcut (default: Ctrl+N), enter a script name, and it will be created next to the currently open script.

You can also select some text and press the shortcut to use that name.

You can also right-click a resource tree folder and pick `Create > Create here` to create scripts in that directory.

If used in conjunction with [Peek Aside](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmedit-peek-aside), the new script will be opened in a side-view.
